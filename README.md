This project was made for a "client" that needed a website made for their dog restaurant. 

We started by suggesting concepts for the website build. Since Benjamin and I didn't know eachother before this,
we sat down and talked through some ideas.

Once we had a general understanding of what we envisioned, we both went over to Figma and created our own wire frame.

After we both had a chance at looking at the other's mockup, we discovered items we liked from both mockups and I applied them 
to a new mockup. The second draft was a hit and we split up the development using the second mockup as the basis for 
creativity. Once we had the general gist of what it was to look like, we freestyled the other pages. Benjamin did the treats page while I did
the index page and the contact page. I also did a small amount of JS for each page, but ran out of time to develop further functionality.
